    <h1>Why I'm Cool</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>I do cool things</h2>
        <p>In May 2022, I was the state winner in a contest called, "Doodle For Google". 
            I got a free laptop and some other things like my backpack and water bottle 
            along with the bag and laptop. I also had a clicks per second rate of 7.8
            when I was around 13, and a typing speed of around 59-60 words per minute. 
            I've been to 9 countries: Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, The UK, Ireland,
            Iceland, Canada, and Australia. I plan on visiting Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan
            again sometime in the future. I am also said to be an exceptional artist and writer, though I wonder if this 
            statement said to me by the people in my life is really true.  
            Last but not least, I have rickrolled my teachers about 4 times in the past, and
            I plan to do it again.

        <h2>I was banned from the playground for a week</h2>
        <p>When I was 10, I was wrongfully convicted of "being bad" during recess in fifth grade. 
            I was sentenced to a week on the barren, desolate, icy blacktop along with my seven 
            comrades, where we conspired with one another to devise a plan to continue playing our game, 
            which was a game based off of a game I used to play a lot back in 5th grade: flee the facility. 
            In a forgotten corner of the wilderness (it was really just far out in the field by the playground),
            a rebellion brewed. We came up with ways to conceal our almost "secret society" from those who opposed
            us so we could continue fleeing the facility. But we knew that 7 ten year olds were like miniscule drops 
            of water versus a tsunami; we would only end up extending our ban from the playground if we fired back and rebelled. 
            So we did what any noble warriors would do and waited for the week to end. It was a grueling five days of 
            pretending we were sitting by a fire and just talking about life while just watching and waiting like
            vultures waiting for their prey to drop. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, then Friday. This was it--the last day.
            Two of my friends were considering taking the risk and entering the playground before our ban was lifted, 
            but I was able to convince them that it wasn't worth it with all the snitches lurking in every corner and all the 
            supervisors covering every vulnerable place in the perimeter of the playground. A shout came from the door. 
            It was lunch time. Some of my comrades had lost sight of the glow from the embers of our hope early on, 
            but now it seemed like our endless tending to what little flames we could scavenge from the burnt out wood wasn't in
            vain after all. The weekend would come and we would be free at last! The eight of us flocked to the door and 
            entered the school. With enough patience, we'd made it to Friday and would make it to victory and our ban from the playground being lifted. The end. (Very dramatic, do you like it?)

        <h2>I just am</h2>
        <p>I might just be so cool that sichuan peppers do not bother me because of my high spice tolerance 
            I have worked on building since I was as young as 5. If someone who visited four continents in 
            the span of 14 years, won a state-wide contest on his first attempt, is skilled in more than one field, 
            and rickrolled four teachers in the past isn't a cool person, that's a lie.
